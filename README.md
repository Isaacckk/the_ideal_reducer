# The Ideal Reducer

**The Ideal Reducer** is a Python-based desktop application designed to help Chemical Engineering students calculate **residual thermodynamic properties** of pure species based on temperature and pressure inputs.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Select from a wide list of pure species.
- Input temperature and pressure in multiple units.
- Automatically computes:
  - Reduced Temperature (Tr)
  - Reduced Pressure (Pr)
  - Second Virial Coefficients (Bo and B1)
  - Derivatives (dBo/dTr, dB1/dTr)
  - Residual Enthalpy
  - Residual Entropy
  - Residual Molar Volume
- Supports light/dark mode toggling.
- Displays raw species data on demand.
- Built with **Tkinter** for portability and ease of use.
